            <h2>Introduction of ReactJS</h2>
            <h3>What Is ReactJs</h3>
            <p>ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript library used to create user interfaces in a declarative and efficient way. It is a component-based front-end library responsible only for the view layer of a Model View Controller(MVC) architecture. React is used to create modular user interfaces and promotes the development of reusable UI components that display dynamic data. it was created by Jordan Walke, a Software Engineer at the Facebook, the person affected by XHP</p>

            <ul>
                <li>React is a JavaScript library created by Facebook</li>
                <li>React is a User Interface (UI) library</li>
                <li>React is a tool for building UI component</li>
            </ul>

            <p>the React was <b>First deployed</b>for Facebook's Newsfeed application in 2011, and then deployed for instagram.com in 2012.</p>

            <p>it was open-sourced at JSConf US in <b>May 2013</b></p>

            <h3>React.JS History</h3>
            <p>Current version of React.JS is V18.0.0 (April 2022).</p>
            
            <p>Initial Release to the Public (V0.3.0) was in July 2013.</p>
            
            <p>React.JS was first used in 2011 for Facebook's Newsfeed feature.</p>

            <p><b>back in 2011,</b> the develoeprs at Facebook started to face some issues with <b>code maintenance.</b> as the Facebook ads app got an increasing number of feature, the team needed more people to keep it running flawlessly.</p>

            <p>The growing number of team-members and app-features slowed them down as a company. over time, their app became <b>difficult to handle</b>as they faced a lot of cascading updates.</p>
